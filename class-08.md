**SOLID - First 5 Principles of Object Oriented Design**
* *SOLID* - acronym for the first five object-oriented design principles, and it stands for:
  - S - Single-responsiblity Principle - This principle states that a class should have one and only one reason to change, in other words a class should have only one job.
  - O - Open-closed Principle - This principle states that objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. A class should be extendable without modifying the class itself.
  - L - Liskov Substitution Principle - This principle states that let q(x) be a property provable about objects of x of type T. Then q(y) should be provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T. The meaning of this statement is that every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class.
  - I - Interface Segregation Principle - This principle states that a client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use, or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use.
  - D - Dependency Inversion Principle - This principle states that entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions. It states that the high-level module must not depend on the low-level module, but they should depend on abstractions. Also this allows for decoupling.
