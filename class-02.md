**A Guide to Java Loops**
* Looping in programming langauges is a feature that facilitates the execution of a set of instructions until the controlling Boolean-expression evaluates to false.
* Types of loops
  - For loop - allows you to repeat certain operations by incrementing and evaluating a loop counter
  - While loop - repeats a statement or a block of statements while its controlling Boolean-expression is true
  - Do-While loop - like a while loop, but the first condition evaluation happens after the first iteration of the loop
